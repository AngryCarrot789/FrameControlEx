# FrameControlEx
A 2nd version of FrameControl. CBA to fix the old one so i'm remaking it :-)

I primarily made this app with the intent of it being able to send video/audio data to OBS, but making an OBS plugin 
is apparently literally impossible unless you know everything about CMake. So for now, it's just a app that can do pixel 
stuff and send frames to the same or other instances of frame control
